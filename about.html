      From childhood tinkering to professional repair — my story of learning, recovery, and dedication to quality electronics service.

      <img src="Caleb.jpg" alt="Caleb - Retro-ER Owner" style="width: 300px; height: auto; border-radius: 1rem; float: right; margin: 0 0 1.5rem 1.5rem; box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.4);">

      <h3 style="color: var(--accent-soft); margin-top: 2rem;">Where It Started</h3>
      <p style="color: var(--muted); line-height: 1.8;">
        My journey into electronics repair started when I was around ten years old, working on a small RadioShack X-Mod car. Like many young tinkerers, I wanted to upgrade it with new motors and components. When I accidentally broke a battery connection, I saved my own money to buy a soldering iron, taught myself how to solder, and repaired it. That experience sparked a lifelong curiosity for taking things apart, learning how they worked, troubleshooting, and experimenting with electronics and PCBs.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: var(--accent-soft); margin-top: 2rem;">Family Legacy</h3>
      <p style="color: var(--muted); line-height: 1.8;">
        Tech repair runs in my family. My dad repaired computers locally when I was growing up, and my grandfather repaired TVs back in the 80s and 90s. I learned by watching them disassemble laptops, desktops, and old hardware, picking up both skills and mindset. Over the years I continued repairing electronics, building PCs for myself and friends, and steadily developing a deep understanding of diagnostics and restoration.
      </p>
      <p style="color: var(--muted); line-height: 1.8;">
        I took a couple of college-level networking and computing courses, but eventually realized that hands-on experience taught me far more than textbooks. I've been a builder, troubleshooter, and self-guided learner my entire life.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: var(--accent-soft); margin-top: 2rem;">Recovery Through Repair</h3>
      <p style="color: var(--muted); line-height: 1.8;">
        In 2022, I suffered a serious injury that nearly cost me the use of my right hand. After surgery, the doctors recommended repetitive fine-motor-skill activity to preserve muscle control. Repairing electronics became both recovery therapy and personal passion. I began doing console modding and small repair projects for local clients, eventually opening a repair service on Fiverr, where I maintained consistent 5-star ratings and completed a wide range of intricate repair work.
      </p>
      <p style="color: var(--muted); line-height: 1.8;">
        However, the heavy fees taken by Fiverr limited my ability to provide fair pricing for my customers while maintaining access to quality tools and materials. That's what motivated me to launch my own independent repair platform and create Retro-ER as a dedicated brand for honest, personal, high-skill electronics repair.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: var(--accent-soft); margin-top: 2rem;">Today</h3>
      <p style="color: var(--muted); line-height: 1.8;">
        Today, I've regained about 90% function of my dominant hand, with improved technique and even more capability thanks to learning to work more ambidextrously. After years of hands-on experience, real-world problem solving, and customer-focused service, I bring skilled craftsmanship and genuine dedication to every repair I take on.
